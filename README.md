## The Project

This week we worked with Azure Cognitive Services. We had the mission to create three speakers profiles and see if we could make the system recognize their voices in recorded conversations. A complete report on our findings can be found **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZghhr8eb_nBc_za7iRg89DK23BSe1QFJke7FPEaRtM/edit?usp=sharing)**
